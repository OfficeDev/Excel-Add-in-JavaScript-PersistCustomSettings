##Summary
This sample plug-in for Office demonstrates how to save custom settings in a plug-in in Word 2013, Excel 2013, PowerPoint 2013, or Project Professional 2013. The plug-in stores data as key/value pairs, using the JavaScript API for Office property bag, browser cookies, web storage (**localStorage** and **sessionStorage**), or by storing the data in a hidden div in the document. The plug-in also demonstrates best practices for implementing multiple-page navigation in an plug-in for Office.
