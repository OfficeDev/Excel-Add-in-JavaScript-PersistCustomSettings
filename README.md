##Summary
This sample demonstrates how to save custom settings inside an Excel Add-in. The add-in stores data as key/value pairs, using the JavaScript API for Office property bag, browser cookies, web storage (**localStorage** and **sessionStorage**), or by storing the data in a hidden div in the document. The add-in also demonstrates best practices for implementing multiple-page navigation in an add-in for Office.
